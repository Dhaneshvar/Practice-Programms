Networking:
- Interconnect b/w 2 or more device
- to sharing data

NIC Network Interface Card.

It Holds two things
1) MAC Address - Medium Access Control
cmd -> getmac
cmd -> ipconfig
cmd -> ipconfig /All

is the serial Number for NIC Card.
48 Bit Address
Divide into 24 bit
First 24 Bit Vendor ID
Second 24 Bit Customer ID
in Hexadecimal Format

2) IP Address

IP4 - Not Based on GeoGraphicalArea, Class A,B,C,D,E,F
IP6 - Based on GeoGraphicalArea, no Classes

Types of Networking:

1.LAN - Local Area Network.
2.WAN - Wide Area Network.
3.MAN - Metropolitian Area Network.
4.CAN - Campus Area Network.
5.PAN - Personal Area Network.
6.SAN - Storage Area Network.

Types of Connection:
1.Wired
2.Wireless

1.Peer-to-Peer Connection ->  one to Another System direct Connection. Secure and Fast. (Here PEER - SYSTEM)
2.ClientServer Connection -> 

Cisco Packet Tracer -> Visual Stimulation.
pkt extension.

1.End User -> PC -> Click PC(Rename) Take 2 PC.
2.Auto Connnection and Connect 2 PC.
3.Packet (Messsage box icon on top) and click on 2 PC.
4.Click on PC -> Destop -> IP Configuraton -> 10.0.0.10 -> Now Packet Color Change to GREEN.
   Same give to Another PC ALso.
   Give Consecutive IP Address (i.e)11,12,..20.
5.Click Stimulation -> Click Run .
6.Click pc -> Destop -> CMD -> ping 10.0.0.20 (USed to check connection pc2 from pc1 and vice versa)

ping - Packet Internet Groper

Multiple System Connnection:
1. Create 5 - 10 PC.
2. Bring switch 2960 24TT Switch 0 and connect.
3. Set IP to all PC. 

hub - sender to all receiver, increase network Traffic, BroadCast
switch - destination find using MAC Address and send to that destination only, MultiCast, reduce Network Pollution, act as forwarder..
a) managable - can configure each and every port and (ON/OFF)
b) Unmanagable - cannot do anything

Topology: Logical Structure
1.star topology only implemented in Praicially
2.all other are only theory concept only.

IPV4 - 32 bit, 4 octet 3 period
Doted Decimal Notation
each octet has 0-255.

class A -> 0-127    N,H,H,H  128
class B -> 128-191  N,N,H,H  64
class C -> 192-223  N,N,N,H  32
class D -> 

Eg: 10.0.0.1 and 10.0.0.255 Should not be Given connections.
