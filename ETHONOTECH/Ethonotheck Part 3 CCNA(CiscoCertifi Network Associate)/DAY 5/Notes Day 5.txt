IP Address:
An indentifier for a computer or device on a TCP/IP network. Network using the TCP/IP protocol route message based on the IP address of the destination. 

Class A - Supports 16 millions hosts on each of 127 networks.
Class B - Supports 65,000 Hosts on each of 16,000 networks.
Class C - Suports 254 hosts on each 2 millions networks.

IPv4 : 4 octets,  seperated by Periods.
IPv6 : hexadecimal, Seperated by Colons.

Dual-stack nodes : 0:0:0:0:0:0:w.x.y.z Both as IPv4 and IPv6

Loopback address : 127.0.0.0 - Network number that cannot be assigned to any network.
127.0.0.1 used for diagnostic testing of the local TCP/IP installation.

APIPA IP : 169.254.x.x
Automatic Private IP Addressing
Ip address are self-assigned when the computer ask for an IP address and no one responds.
(ie.) the computer cannot reach a DHCP server over the network.

Lab Excersise:

1.From End Device -> Take 1 PC, Laptop, Tablet, SmartPhone.
2.Network Device -> WireLess Device -> WRT300N -> Drag and Drop in WorkSpace. Now Tablet, SmartPhone Get Connected.
3.Click PC -> PHYSICAL -> Physical Device Preview la -> OFF the PC -> Drag the RJ45 Module and put in the empyt space left bottom -> Drag WMP300N Modules -> ON the PC.
4. Do the same for LAPTOP.
5.Now data/Packet transfer Done Easily.
6.Confiure the Wireless Router WRT300N

1.From End Device -> Take 1 PC, Laptop, Tablet, SmartPhone.

2.wireless router0 -> cli -> DHCP (DISABLE) ->Save Settings.

3.Wireless tab -> network Name -> CSE. Now Automatic Connection ablet, SmartPhone will be Disabed.

4.Click PC -> PHYSICAL -> Physical Device Preview la -> OFF the PC -> Drag the RJ45 Module and put in the empyt space left bottom -> Drag WMP300N Modules -> ON the PC.

5. Do the same for LAPTOP.

6.Click PC -> Choose STATIC -> Assign ip : 10.0.0.1 and Subnet : 255.0.0.0 and DefaultGateway is the Router ip Address.(i.e Here) 192.168.0.1

7.Cick PC,Laptop -> Destop Tab -> Wireless Connect -> Connect Tab -> Click Refresh Button -> In Wireless Network Name we get CSE Click that and click Connect Button.

8.tabet,SmartPhone -> config -> SSID :  CSE (give the Name).

DHCP Server Setting:
1.Server -> assign Ip address : 192.168.0.1

2.On the same Server -> service -> DHCP -> ON the  Service -> Default Gateway : 192.168.0.1 (same as server Address)

3.Start IP Address :  192.168.0.0
0.0 because 0.1 is assigned to Server and gatway and 0.2,0.3,0.4 etc.. assinged to consecutive system/PC.

4.Subnet Mask : 255.255.255.0

5.Max Number of User : 256 (we can assign the number of system)

6. PC -> Destop -> On the DHCP  .

7. Configure the Router with 
en
conf t
int fa0/0
ip address 192.168.0.1 255.0.0.0
no shutdown
exit
exit

Between Host and Server:
Server discover signal -> ip Lease offer -> ip lease request -> acknowlegement signal.

Disadvantage:
1.Day by Day IP Address Changes
2.overloop of ip
